## 🎯 HOW WE’LL STUDY (Recommended)

Since your **math base is weak**, we will:

* 📌 Learn **1 topic per day**
* 📌 Start with **very easy examples**
* 📌 Then move to **placement-level questions**
* 📌 Use **short tricks only after concepts**

---

### ✅ NEXT STEP

We will **start from Topic 1** properly.

👉 **Say “Start Topic 1”**
and I’ll teach **numbers + place value** from absolute basics with examples.
